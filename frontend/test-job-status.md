# Job Status Management Test Plan

## 🔍 **Issue Analysis Complete**
- **Problem**: All jobs showing "running" status permanently
- **Root Cause**: WebSocket event handling gaps and data merging issues
- **Solution**: Comprehensive event handling and smart job merging

## 🛠️ **Fixes Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced WebSocket Event Handling**
- Added listeners for multiple completion events: `job:completed`, `job:finished`, `job:failed`, `job:error`
- Unified completion handler with proper status mapping
- Added `job:progress` event handling for real-time updates
- Enhanced debugging with event logging

### **2. Smart Job Data Merging**
- JobStore now prioritizes WebSocket updates over stale REST API data
- Intelligent merging logic that preserves completion status from WebSocket events
- Prevents REST API from overriding fresh WebSocket status updates

### **3. Comprehensive Debugging**
- Added console logs throughout the data flow chain
- WebSocket event reception logging
- Job status change tracking
- Component render debugging

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### **Manual Test Steps:**
1. **Open Browser Console** - Watch for debug logs
2. **Navigate to VM Orchestrator** - http://localhost:5185/
3. **Select a VM** - Choose any available VM
4. **Execute a Command** - Run a simple command like `echo "test"`
5. **Monitor Console Logs** - Look for:
   ```
   📨 WebSocket received job:started: {...}
   🚀 Job started: {...}
   [JobStore] Adding job with status: running
   [JobHistory] filteredJobs X jobs, statuses: ['running']
   [Job] render jobId status: running
   ```
6. **Wait for Completion** - Watch for completion events:
   ```
   📨 WebSocket received job:completed: {...}
   ✅ Job job:completed: {...}
   [JobStore] Updating job status to: completed
   [JobHistory] filteredJobs X jobs, statuses: ['completed']
   [Job] render jobId status: completed
   ```

### **Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Job starts with "running" status
- ✅ Job updates to "completed" or "failed" when finished
- ✅ JobHistory component shows correct status
- ✅ Job statistics update properly
- ✅ No permanent "running" jobs (unless actually running)

### **Debug Console Commands:**
```javascript
// Check current job store state
$jobStore = window.jobStore || {};
console.log('Current jobs:', $jobStore.jobs);

// Check WebSocket connection
$wsClient = window.wsClient || {};
console.log('WebSocket connected:', $wsClient.isConnected);

// Force refresh jobs
if (window.jobStore) window.jobStore.refreshJobs();
```

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**
- [ ] Jobs transition from "running" to "completed"/"failed"
- [ ] WebSocket events are received and processed
- [ ] Job statistics reflect accurate status counts
- [ ] No stale "running" jobs in the list
- [ ] Real-time status updates work correctly
