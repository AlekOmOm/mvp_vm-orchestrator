# Core Design Principles

## Essential Concepts

### Personal Accountability
Every requirement must have a named individual owner (not department). Enables direct questioning and prevents requirements that persist without advocates.

### Sequential Application
Complete each step before proceeding. Skipping steps leads to optimizing things that shouldn't exist.

### Addition Bias Recognition
Default human tendency is to add features. Counter this by systematically deleting first, optimizing second.

### Authority Bias Mitigation
Requirements from "smart people" are most dangerous because they resist questioning. Challenge these most rigorously.

## Key Questions by Step

**Step 1 - Requirements**: What assumptions am I accepting without evidence?

**Step 2 - Deletion**: If rebuilding from scratch, what would I definitely include?

**Step 3 - Optimization**: Am I optimizing something that survived deletion analysis?

**Step 4 - Acceleration**: Am I confident enough in direction to increase speed?

**Step 5 - Automation**: Will this automation help or hurt future flexibility?

## Common Failure Patterns

- Jumping to optimization without deletion
- Accepting requirements due to source authority
- Adding "just in case" features
- Automating processes before optimizing them
- Accelerating in wrong direction
