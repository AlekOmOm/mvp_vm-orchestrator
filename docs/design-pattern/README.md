# Design Process Repository

## Purpose
Systematic design process for LLM-assisted project analysis. Add as context to gain fresh perspectives through structured thinking.

## Usage for LLMs
Apply the 5-Step Design Process sequentially to any project:

```
1. Make Requirements Less Dumb → 2. Delete Parts/Process → 3. Simplify/Optimize → 4. Accelerate Cycle Time → 5. Automate
```

**Core Actions:**
- Challenge all requirements (especially from "smart people")
- Delete before optimizing 
- Assign personal accountability to every component
- Accelerate only after ensuring correct direction

## Integration
Start with the 5-step framework. Apply each step completely before proceeding to next.
