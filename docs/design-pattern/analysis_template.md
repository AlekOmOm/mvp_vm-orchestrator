# Quick Analysis Guide

## Project Setup
**Project**: _[Name]_
**Current State**: _[Brief description]_
**Key Stakeholders**: _[Who decides/uses]_

## Step 1: Challenge Requirements
- List current requirements
- Identify who specified each (by name, not department)
- Question assumptions, especially from "smart people"
- Focus: Are we solving the right problem?

## Step 2: Delete Ruthlessly  
- Identify "just in case" features
- Find components without clear advocates
- Apply 10% rule: plan to add back 10% of deletions
- Focus: What's the minimal viable version?

## Step 3: Optimize What Remains
- Only optimize post-deletion survivors
- Consider system-wide impact before local optimization
- Focus: Are we optimizing the right things?

## Step 4: Accelerate Smartly
- Ensure direction confidence before speed increases
- Build rapid feedback loops
- Focus: How fast can we learn and iterate?

## Step 5: Automate Last
- Only automate perfected, stable processes
- Consider flexibility cost of automation
- Focus: Is this process worth locking in?

## Key Questions Per Step
1. **Requirements**: What assumptions am I not questioning?
2. **Deletion**: What would I add back if forced to rebuild from scratch?
3. **Optimization**: Am I optimizing something that shouldn't exist?
4. **Acceleration**: Am I confident enough in direction to go faster?
5. **Automation**: Will this automation help or hurt future flexibility?
