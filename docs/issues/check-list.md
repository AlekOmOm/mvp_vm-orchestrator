# Front-end Service Migration – Live Checklist

## ✅ Completed
- Core clients registered in `ServiceContainer` (`apiClient`, `jobsWebSocketClient`).
- `JobWebSocketService` implemented and registered as `jobSocketService`.
- `vmService` registered as singleton in `ServiceContainer` (path `modules/vm/services/VMService.js`).
- `vmStore` migrated to use `vmService` (`/api/ssh-hosts`, `/api/ssh-hosts/:alias/test`).
- `commandStore` migrated to use `apiClient` directly (`/api/vms/{vmId}/commands`, `/api/commands`).
- `Dashboard` and `ExecutionPanel` fully on DI stack.
- Legacy `WebSocketService.js` removed from runtime (file still exists on disk – see To-Do).
- CRUD Commands UI implemented (Add, Edit, Delete) integrated with `commandStore` and `ExecutionPanel`.
- Frontend services split: `SshHostService`, `VmsService`, `CommandService` registered in `ServiceContainer`.
- Automatic VM registration: `VMService.ensureRegistered()` + backend startup sync now guarantee SSH hosts are registered in `/api/vms`.
- **All stores migrated to ServiceContainer**: `vmStore` uses `vmService`, `commandStore` uses `commandService`, `jobStore` and `logStore` implemented with base store pattern.
- **Command execution flow consolidated**: Single path through `CommandExecutionService` → `JobService` → `JobWebSocketService`.

---
## ✅ **RESOLVED**: Unified Command Execution Implementation
- **NEW**: Single `CommandExecutor` service consolidates all command execution logic
- **UNIFIED PATH**: All components now use: `CommandExecutor.executeCommand()` → `JobService.executeCommand()` → `JobWebSocketService.executeCommand()`
- **ELIMINATED DUPLICATES**:
  - `CommandExecutionView` migrated to use `CommandExecutor`
  - `CommandPanel` migrated to use `CommandExecutor`
  - Legacy `CommandExecutionService` removed
  - Direct `VMService.executeCommand()` path eliminated
- **CENTRALIZED STATE**: Single execution state management with proper queuing
- **BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY**: Service container provides alias for smooth transition

---
## ✅ **RESOLVED**: LogStore Runtime Error Fixed
- **ISSUE**: `base.update is not a function` error when adding log lines during command execution
- **ROOT CAUSE**: BaseStore pattern didn't expose the raw `update` method, but logStore was trying to call it directly
- **SOLUTION**:
  - Added `update` method to baseStore return object for direct state updates
  - LogStore simplified to use writable store directly (user cleanup)
- **RESULT**: Log handling now works correctly without breaking command execution flow
- **TESTED**: ✅ Application loads successfully, VM selection works, command loading works, no runtime errors

---
## ✅ **RESOLVED**: Svelte 5 Compatibility & Accessibility Fixes
- **Event Handler Migration**: Updated `frontend/src/lib/components/ui/textarea/textarea.svelte`
  - **SOLUTION**: Removed explicit event handler declarations, using `{...restProps}` spread for proper Svelte 5 compatibility
  - **RESULT**: All `on:*` deprecation warnings eliminated
- **State Management Migration**: Fixed `frontend/src/lib/components/ui/StatusBadge.svelte`
  - **SOLUTION**: Converted reactive variables to use `$state()` and `$derived()` runes
  - **CHANGES**: `IconComponent`, `isLoading` now use `$state()`, `combinedClasses` uses `$derived()`
  - **RESULT**: All non-reactive update warnings eliminated
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Fixed `frontend/src/lib/components/ui/Modal.svelte`
  - **SOLUTION**: Added `tabindex="-1"` to dialog element, added `role="document"` to content, removed problematic onclick handler
  - **RESULT**: All accessibility violations resolved
- **BUILD STATUS**: ✅ Clean build with no Svelte warnings or accessibility violations

---
## ✅ **RESOLVED**: Job Components Enhancement & JobStore Integration
- **JobHistory Component**: Completely redesigned to fully utilize jobStore capabilities
  - **ENHANCED FEATURES**: Statistics display, better error handling, improved filtering, retry functionality
  - **JOBSTORE INTEGRATION**: Uses all derived stores (jobStats, currentVMJobs, recentJobs, etc.)
  - **PERFORMANCE**: Optimized filtering with $derived.by(), proper loading states, caching support
  - **UX IMPROVEMENTS**: Better empty states, progress indicators, VM-specific job views
- **JobLogModal Component**: Redesigned to avoid circular dependency issues
  - **SOLUTION**: Uses jobService directly instead of logService, implements proper error handling
  - **FEATURES**: Log downloading, refresh functionality, better loading states, terminal-style display
  - **CACHING**: Integrates with logStore for cached log display
- **Job Component**: Enhanced with better status mapping and time formatting
  - **STATUS SUPPORT**: Added support for more job statuses (pending, queued, completed, etc.)
  - **TIME DISPLAY**: Improved duration formatting (seconds, minutes, hours)
  - **PERFORMANCE**: Optimized derived calculations, removed unused code

---
## ✅ **RESOLVED**: Job Status Management & WebSocket Event Handling
- **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Jobs showing permanent "running" status due to WebSocket event handling issues
  - **ISSUE 1**: JobWebSocketService only listened for `job:done` events, missing other completion events
  - **ISSUE 2**: JobStore merging logic prioritized stale REST API data over fresh WebSocket updates
  - **ISSUE 3**: Missing event listeners for various job completion event types
- **COMPREHENSIVE FIX IMPLEMENTED**:
  - **Enhanced Event Handling**: Added listeners for `job:completed`, `job:finished`, `job:failed`, `job:error`, `job:progress`
  - **Smart Job Merging**: JobStore now prioritizes WebSocket updates over stale REST data
  - **Unified Completion Handler**: Single handler for all completion events with proper status mapping
  - **Enhanced Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging for WebSocket events and job state changes
  - **Data Flow Tracing**: Added console logs throughout JobHistory → JobList → Job component chain
- **TESTING READY**: System now properly handles job lifecycle from running → completed/failed status

---
## ✅ **RESOLVED**: Svelte 5 Infinite Effect Loop - CRITICAL FIX
- **CRITICAL ISSUE**: `effect_update_depth_exceeded` error causing browser freeze
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: `$effect` in JobHistory was reading and modifying the same reactive variable (`limit`)
  - **SYMPTOM**: Infinite loop preventing JobHistory component from rendering
- **IMMEDIATE FIX APPLIED**:
  - **Removed Problematic Effect**: Eliminated `$effect(() => { if (limit > MAX_DISPLAY) limit = MAX_DISPLAY; })`
  - **Replaced with Derived**: Used `$derived(Math.min(limit, MAX_DISPLAY))` for safe computation
  - **Updated All References**: Changed all `limit` usage to `effectiveLimit` where needed
  - **Reduced Console Spam**: Minimized debugging logs to prevent performance issues
- **RESULT**: JobHistory component now renders without infinite loops, browser performance restored

---
## 🚧 Current Issues
- **LogService Circular Dependency**: LogService imports ServiceContainer, but ServiceContainer imports LogService
  - **Impact**: Reduced - JobLogModal now works around this by using jobService directly
  - **Location**: `frontend/src/lib/modules/logs/logService.js:7` imports ServiceContainer
  - **Solution Needed**: Remove ServiceContainer import from LogService or restructure dependency
- Stale deprecated files on disk (`WebSocketService.js`, docs in `docs/deprecated/`)

---
## 🔑 Immediate Actions
1. **Fix duplicate execution paths**
   * **ANALYSIS COMPLETE**: Dashboard.svelte does NOT have duplicate emit - `handleCommandExecute()` only logs
   * **REAL ISSUE**: Two active execution components:
     - `CommandExecutionView` (main path) → `CommandExecutionService` → `JobService` → `JobWebSocketService`
     - `CommandPanel` (legacy path) → `VMService.executeCommand()` → direct WebSocket emit
   * **ACTION**: Deprecate `CommandPanel` or consolidate execution paths
2. **Smoke-test VM list endpoint**
   * `/api/ssh-hosts` → VM list populates & scrolls.

---
## 🔄 Work In Progress
- [x] `/api/vms/{vmId}/commands` → commands load; execute via WebSocket; logs stream.
  * Execute button now calls `jobService.executeCommand()`; logs stream reactively.

- [x] Service layer completeness
  * `JobService` exposes `executeCommand`, `getCurrentJob`, `getLogLines`, `getConnectionStatus`.
  * UI components now use `jobService` via DI; legacy socket references removed.
  * TODO: design persistent caching for `currentJob` beyond WebSocket lifetime.
